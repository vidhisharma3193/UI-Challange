# ICON UI Developer Take Home

Hi there! Thank you for setting aside the time to tackle this development exercise. We're re-imagining the home building and construction process and if you've made it this far that means we're seriously considering inviting you to be a part of our team. Congratulations!! I hope you're as excited as we are.

## About this exercise
We don't want you to spend more than 2 hours working on this problem and expect a solution to be submitted within 2 hours and 30 minutes of when you download this package. The 30 minute buffer is intended to give you time to look at the problem and the way we've set up our files and get yourself comfortable with the way it's working.

For simplicity, we've use the standard `create-react-app` leveraging a Typescript template to get you started. There is only one component you need to focus on:  `PurgeButton`.

Build for modern browsers and don't worry about legacy browser support or making sure this is responsive or usable on mobile devices. Supporting multiple gesture types and element resizing is outside of the scope of this exercise. We will be viewing your work in a Chrome browser on desktop, so feel free to optimize for that.

We'll be looking for a well developed interaction that leverages React and basic CSS to create what feels like a highly interactive element.

## Restrictions
We want to know how _you_ work. **Please do not add any additional libraries or pull code samples from the internet.** It's totally ok to look around for approaches to make your solution work, but we ask that you put as much _you_ into the project as possible.

## Design
You can access the design file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/HDQ6aAV1iD5vmBBLo3zQI2/Exercise?node-id=0%3A1).

Take a breath. Have fun and good luck! We're rooting for you.
